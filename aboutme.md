subtitle: Where once I painted with colors, I now sculpt with code.

My name is Alyssa，Qingyue Chen in Chinese. I have the following qualities:

🎨 Painting — because sometimes colors speak louder than words.

🎤 Singing — my neighbors may not love it, but I do.

📚 Reading novels — escaping reality, one chapter at a time.

🎮 Playing PS5 — saving the world (or destroying it) from the comfort of my couch.

### My story

When I first entered university, I thought I was destined to become a healthcare worker — someone who saves lives and heals the sick. I imagined myself worrying about doctor-patient relationships, or trying to avoid potential conflicts with “medical troublemakers.” I practiced with scalpels, dissecting frogs, rabbits, and hamsters, and studied the mysteries of the human body with the guidance of our “silent teachers” in the anatomy lab. Towering piles of textbooks and endless streams of knowledge filled my mind. I believed that after eight years of training, I would emerge as a brilliant physician.

But reality struck during my hospital internship. I came to realize that most of the world’s serious diseases are, in fact, incurable. I witnessed an eight-year-old calmly discussing life and death with me; I saw bedridden octogenarians cared for only by hired aides; and due to the shortage of medical staff, I — just a student intern — was asked to give injections to confused patients, despite not being properly qualified. After six months, frustration and disillusionment weighed heavily on me. The major I once thought was noble had become a heavy burden.

Yet I still believed that, as someone young, my possibilities were limitless. So I turned back to an old passion — the world of code. I remembered my high school days, when I stayed up late writing C++ programs for the Informatics Olympiad. I remembered waking up at 6 a.m., studying until midnight, and living without holidays. I remembered the competition where I failed, all because nervousness led me to mismatched function names. At sixteen, my dream was cut short; at eighteen, I decided to pick it up again.

Despite the crushing load of medical courses, I carved out bits of spare time — between classes and part-time jobs — to dive into Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning lectures and Hung-yi Lee’s practical courses. I explored NLP, CV, ML, and gradually stumbled upon papers like MedSAM2, architectures like U-Net and U-Net++, and top conferences such as NeurIPS, CVPR, and AAAI. I began to see the possibilities at the intersection of medicine and AI. I was not running away from medicine; rather, I hoped to use AI to transform the human journey of life.

Eventually, under the guidance of a mentor, I began research on uterine fibroids and published my first paper on arXiv with my name on it. Imaging, pathology, HCL, and countless other AI–medicine crossovers began to flow into my daily life. Through discussions with researchers around the world, my horizons and mindset expanded, and I found myself filled with the excitement of discovery.

That is who I am today.
And the future me will keep sharing updates here.
